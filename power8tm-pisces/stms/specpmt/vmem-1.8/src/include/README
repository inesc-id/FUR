VMEM

This is src/include/README.

This directory contains include files that are meant to be installed on
a system when vmem and vmmalloc libraries are installed.
These include files provide the public information exported
by the libraries that is necessary for applications to call into
the libraries.  Private include files, used only internally in
the libraries, don't live here -- they typically live next to
the source for their module.

Here you'll find:

libvmem.h -- definitions of libvmem entry points (see libvmem(3))

libvmmalloc.h -- definitions of libvmmalloc entry points (see libvmmalloc(3))
